# stabilization-avionics

I'll work on this soon...

Right now we're trying to get data from a 10 DoF and activate solenoids from a Teensy 3.6

To get started download Teensyduino from here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
It should be that easy.

Basic code practices:
  1. Don't commit code that doesn't compile
  2. Use camelCase for variables and snake_case for functions (that's what avionics is doing, so things will mess nicely later)
  3. Don't commit code that doesn't compile!
